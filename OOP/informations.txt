everything in python is actually a class, like a int, a str, a list, a dictionary. All those things are actually a class that can give origin to an object

types:
tuple() = ()
list() = []
dict() = {}
int() = 54

You should use the first letter of every function you create Capitalized, because python functions and classes are all lowercase, so, for to
any errors to happen without knowing, you should make the first letter of your classes and functions in uppercase

@staticmethod exist

tuple:
    return name, house
    or
    return (name, house)

    in this case, tuple is kinda a list that will return an imutable list with in this case the variables name and house
